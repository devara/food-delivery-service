How to test this API

## Section 1: Features

- List all restaurants within the vicinity of the user’s location or (any location), ranked by distance (the distances will be displayed in the app)
- List all restaurants that are open for x-z hours per day or week
- List all restaurants that have x-z number of dishes within a price range
- List all restaurants that are open at a certain datetime
- Search for restaurants or dishes by name, ranked by relevance to search term
- Search for restaurants that has a dish matching search term
- The top x users by total transaction amount within a date range
- The most popular restaurants by transaction volume, either by number of transactions or transaction amount
- Total number of users who made transactions above or below $v within a date range
- List all transactions belonging to a restaurant
- List all transactions belonging to a user
- Process a user purchase in an atomic manner and ensure the changes of cash balances can be applied safely and correctly

## Section 2: Tech

The API uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) - Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/3) - Most popular database for modern apps
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - API Development for Everyone.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Empowering App Development for Developers

## Section 3: Setup the API

### 3.1: Build the Dockerfile

Before we import raw data to the database (mongodb), we need to build this application using Docker.
Since we are using the mongodb image from Docker, we need to prepare it and make sure it runs before importing the raw data.

First, copy **.env.example** file into **.env**

Then, in the root of project folder, using terminal, run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Wait for the Docker build to finish.
You will have 2 images:

- docker image for this app
- bitnami/mongodb image

### 3.2: Importing Raw Data to MongoDB

Now that the Docker Container is running, we can start importing our raw data into MongoDB.

The database name is **food-app**.

I recommend installing [MongoDB Compas](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) to access the database. So, you can check if the data has been properly imported into the MongoDB collection.

MongoDB access details:

| Field       | Value                 |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Hostname    | 0.0.0.0               |
| Port        | 27017                 |
| Auth method | username and password |
| Username    | janganroot            |
| Password    | letmein-iamhungry     |
| Database    | food-app              |

For the steps to import raw data, you can also check the API [documentation page](http://127.0.0.1:3000/docs) to import user data and restaurant data.

You can use Postman to import data for a better experience, although you can import directly via the [documentation page](http://127.0.0.1:3000/docs) using the supplied import endpoints.
Because when I import raw data on my local device, it took a little while, maybe around 40 seconds to 1 minute, or more.

We have two raw data (**users.json** and **restaurants.json**), but when the import is finished, I split them into 4 collections:

- restaurants
- menus
- users
- transactions

When import **users.json**, it will create two collections, **users** and **transactions**.
For **restaurants.json**, it will create **restaurants** and **menus**.

Steps if you are using postman:

- Use the endpoint: **127.0.0.0:3000/api/v1/user** with POST method
- We are not use params, but body request, and then choose **raw** method using JSON type
- Copy all **users.json** data into body request field (raw data must be wrapped as an array)
- Execute this endpoint and wait untill import process is done
- Check mongoDB compas, it will be create **users** collection (in my local, there are 999 documents), and **transactions** collection (in my local there are 9308 documents)
- Next to import restaurants data
- Use the endpoint: **127.0.0.0:3000/api/v1/restaurant** with POST method and using body request as same as when import users data
- Copy all **restaurants.json** data into request field then execute and wait it (maybe this is a little bit longer, because the data is quite a lot)
- It will be create **restaurants** collection (968 documents) and **menus** collection (18.673 documents)
- For the record, the restaurant with the same name, I merged into one document

After all the import process is complete, we can start using this API and you can next go to documentatin section.

## Section 4: API Documentation

Want to check the API features? Lets begin!

I am use the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for serve the API documentation.
You can access the documentation page to test all endpoints from this API.
Go to [docs page](http://127.0.0.1:3000/docs)
You can find all endpoints to check all the features this API can do.

## Section 5: API Testing

I'm sorry if I just made a simple test for this API.

To test this API, I used the [Tap](https://node-tap.org/) test and [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)

You can run the API testing using CLI.
If docker container for this app is running, go to the docker CLI.
You can run:

```sh
npm run test
```

Then, You will see the results.

I'm sorry if this test case isn't perfect.

I hope you are happy with my assignment.
